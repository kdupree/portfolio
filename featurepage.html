     <h1>Cheerleading</h1>
     <h3 class="featurepage"> I've been in cheerleading for 3 years now but I actually started in elementary school. I don't consider those years because once I got into middle school I realized the difference between professional cheerleading and cheering on other teams. Cheerleading has been a great experience for me. It opened up multiple oppurtunities and gave me a chance to meet new people in a new place.</h3>
